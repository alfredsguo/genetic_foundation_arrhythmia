# Genetic Foundations of Cellular and Transcriptional Alterations in Cardiac Arrhythmias
## Background
Cardiac arrhythmias significantly contribute to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced molecular insights for improved clinical management. 
## Gaps
The correlation between genetic variants and gene expression alterations in arrhythmias is broadly acknowledged, yet insufficiently explored. Our study adopts a multi-omics approach, integrating genetic and transcriptomic data, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cardiac arrhythmias. 
## Approach & Results
We began by analyzing whole-exome data from 50 patients, identifying a consistent mutation pattern in genes associated with immune response and extracellular matrix remodeling. This genomic pattern was mirrored in our single-cell analyses, revealing consistent transcriptional changes across various cell types, predominantly in pathways regulating immune function and tissue integrity. By correlating these genetic findings with single-cell data, we identified potential molecular drivers of the observed transcriptional alterations. Additionally, we established connections between specific genetic variants and clinical phenotypes.
